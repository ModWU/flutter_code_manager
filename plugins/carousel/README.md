A wrapper around [InheritedWidget]
to make them easier to use and more reusable.

By using `provider` instead of manually writing [InheritedWidget], you get:

- simplified allocation/disposal of resources
- lazy-loading
- a largely reduced boilerplate over making a new class every time
- devtools friendly
- a common way to consume these [InheritedWidget]s (See [Provider.of]/[Consumer]/[Selector])
- increased scalability for classes with a listening mechanism that grows exponentially
  in complexity (such as [ChangeNotifier], which is O(NÂ²) for dispatching notifications).
